		<h1> I'm working on this </h1>
		<p> Start with a paragraph of writing </p>
		<p> In this second paragraph, I want to test the different types of tags that are <i> available </i> </p>
		<p> This paragraph is gonna be me showing that I can use <b> bold </b> and 
			superscripts like this 4<sup>th</sup>
			and subscripts like this: CO<sub>2</sub> </p>
		<p> I can use white spaces
			to make my code easier to read; in addition I can <br />
			do a line break if necessary. To categorize, Use the (hr /) tag like this: <hr /> 
			It can create a line that will represent a division/new category</p>
		<p> <em>Em</em> and <i>I</i> do pretty much the same thing. As do <strong>strong</strong> and <b>bold</b>. </p>

		<blockquote cite = "google.com"> <p> When you're writing a quote, you can use block quote.
			I believe it should even indent for you, but don't typically indent with this. 
			Use the "cite" keyword to link where the quote is from.</blockquote>

		<p> Now let's talk about <abbr title = "Startup High School">SHS</abbr>, a pretty awesome
			initiative that Ovi Datta and Eric Yu are working on. (Used abbr tag on SHS) </p>

		<p> Strikethroughs are done with the <del>del keyword</del> and <ins>inserts</ins> with the ins 
			keyword. You can do <s>strikethrough</s> with the s tag also </p>
