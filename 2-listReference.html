	<p> 
		I need to make a list of my sleep cycle,
		so I figure I might as well just start here.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li> Wake up at 5 am </li>
		<li> Go to bed at 8:40 am </li>
		<li> Wake up at 9:00 am </li>
		<li> GET THIS CYCLE WORKING </li>
	</ol>
	<p> 
		The list above was an ordered list. Below,
		I will now create an unordered list. The primary
		difference between these two lists is how they start off.
		As we can see, an ordered list (ol) uses numbers to split.
		An unordered list (ul) just uses bullet points. 
	</p>
	<ul> 
		<li> For step 2, gotta sleep at 2:20 pm </li>
		<li> Wake up at 2:40 pm </li>
		<li> Last sleep at 7:40 pm </li>
		<li> Finish off waking up at 8:00 pm </li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		This next list is kind of useful but confusing also.
		Essentially, it can be used for definitions 
	</p>
	<dl>
		<dt> Eric </dt>
		<dd> Cool person trying a new sleep cycle </dd>
		<dt> Sandeep </dt>
		<dd> Decent roommate </dd>
		<dt> Kevin </dt>
		<dd> Child </dd>
	</dl>

	<p> Even more cool, you can nest lists inside one another </p>
	<ol> 
		<li> Element of surprise </li>
		<ul> 
			<li> Baskets </li>
			<li> Barbeque </li>
			<li> Lovely </li>
		</ul>
		<li> Element of sadness </li>
		<dl> 
			<dt> Sleep </dt>
			<dd> As a sleep deprived child, this will be an interesting way to start off
			and continue my break. I really believe that I will be able to hold through for the entire break. I BELIEVE </dd>
		</dl>
		<li> That is all </li>
	</ol>
