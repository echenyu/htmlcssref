		<h2 id = "breakfast"> Breakfast </h2>
		<p> During breakfast, one typically eats something to start off
		his or her day. Generally, we don't expect to find anything too oily or 
		too tough to eat for a morning breakfast. Expect something more along the
		lines of eggs, bread, and maybe bacon. Experts have been heard to say that 
		breakfast is the most important meal. We can learn more from an article 
		written by Johns Hopkins that can be <a href = "http://www.jhsph.edu/offices-and-services/student-affairs/_documents/breakfast">found here</a>.</p>
		<p> Breakfast foods vary widely from place to place, but often include a carbohydrate such as grains or cereals, fruit and/or vegetables, a protein food such as eggs, meat or fish, and a beverage such as tea, coffee, milk or fruit juice. Coffee, milk, tea, juice, breakfast cereals, pancakes, waffles, sausages, French toast, bacon, sweetened breads, fresh fruit, vegetables, eggs, mushrooms, baked beans, muffins, crumpets and toast with butter or margarine and/or jam or marmalade are common examples of Western breakfast foods, though a large range of preparations and ingredients are associated with breakfast globally. </p>

		<h2 id = "lunch"> Lunch </h2>
		<p> Lunch is generally also a very important meal to eat during the day. I 
		love lunch and I think it is my favorite meal. The past few weeks, I've been
		eating out a lot during lunch, but I think it's time that I start cooking
		food again. Although buffalo wild wings, 5 guys, and tomukun taste great,
		they also drain my wallet very quickly! Lunch, an abbreviation of luncheon, is a midday meal[1] of varying size depending on the culture. The origin of the words lunch and luncheon relate to a small meal originally eaten at any time of the day or night, but during the 20th century gradually focused toward a small or mid-sized meal eaten at midday. Lunch is the second meal of the day after breakfast.

		<h2 id = "dinner"> Dinner </h2>
		<p> Dinner has nothing more to say. Just eat a healthy dinner and you will
		be satisifed and it tastes yummy too! </p>

		<p> To do the in text links, add the (id) tag inside brackets. Currently,
		they have been added inside (h2) brackets. The links on the top utilize
		a (#) link. Essentially, link to the id tag, but add a # in front of it. Dinner usually refers to the most significant meal of the day, which can be the noon or the evening meal. However, the term "dinner" can have many different meanings depending on the culture; it may mean a meal of any size eaten at any time of day.[1] [2] Historically, it referred to the first meal of the day, eaten around noon, and is still sometimes used for a noontime meal, particularly if it is a large or main meal. However, the meaning as the evening meal, generally the largest of the day, is becoming standard in most parts of the English-speaking world. The average dinner time in the U.K. for those who call their evening meal dinner has been found to be at 7.47pm.</p>
