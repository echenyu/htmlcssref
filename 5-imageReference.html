		<h1> Sophomore Year Pics </h1>
		<p> Let's just insert my first picture in here! </p>
		<img src = "images/1kp.jpg" alt = "Me with the 1000 pitches guy" 
		width="600" height="450"/>
		
		<p> In making this image, I needed to use the (img) tag with (src).
		I can specify the width and height with "width" and "height". That being
		said, a lot of the image size is now being determined by CSS instead. 
		</p>

		<p> <img src = "images/bday.jpg" alt = "KKE on my Birthday"
		height="150" width="200" align="right"/>For the next image,  we can align to the side a body of text. As you can see, Katherine Wong and Kevin Tung came to visit me on my birthday. 
		I felt pretty sick that day, but it was a nice surprise seeing them 
		come :) To achieve the right side align, we need to use the "align"
		attribute. Add the image to the beginning of the paragraph as well. This is kind of deprecated now; essentially use CSS to control the
		alignment of images</p>

		<h3> 3 rules to images </h3>
		<ol> 
			<li> Save images in the right format </li>
			<ul>
				<li> Mainly use jpeg, gif, or png for images. 
				If not, speed of loading could be affected </li>
			</ul>
			<li> Save images at the right size </li>
			<ul> 
				<li> Save images at the same size you wish it
				to be displayed on the website. It's just easier
				to do this way! Don't resize normally </li>
			</ul>
			<li> Measure Images in pixels </li>
			<ul>
				<li> When saving pictures, save them in pixels so that
				they can be compared from monitor to monitor! </li>
			</ul>
		</ol>

		<p> In html5, there is now a figure tag that lets you add
		captions as well! </p>
		<figure>
			<img src = "images/food.jpg" alt="Yummy food" height="150"
			width="200"/>
			<br/>
			<figcaption> Omelette and potatoes </figcaption>
		</figure>
		<a href = "3-links.html"> Return to Index </a>
