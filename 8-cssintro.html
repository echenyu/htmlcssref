<!--This page was made primarily just to see what CSS could do at a basic level.
I didn't use any special things to change the color. Just a quick stylesheet
that used RGB, HEX, and the color name.-->

		<h1> Intro to CSS </h1>
		<p>To start with CSS, we need to include a link to the
		CSS file within our directory. To do so, we just use the (link)
		element. The type attribute is always "text/css," and the rel
		(relationship) is always "stylesheet." </p>

		<p id = "p2"> In general, we have a selector and a declaration.
		The selector helps us choose which part of the text/"box" to
		apply the CSS stylesheet to. Declarations help determine what exactly
		to change! This paragraph changed with an id. </p>

		<p class="random">This final paragraph is changed in CSS with 
		its class in the paragraph. I'll use MPowered's yellow for this one. We
		will use hex this time!</p>

		<p> Super quick page on this one! Just wanted to try a few selectors
		and declarations!</p>
