		<h2> EECS 281 Projects</h2>
			<h3> <a class="projtitle" href="profile/p1/project1.cpp">Project 1: Harry Potter</a></h3>
				<p class="project"> For this project, we were asked to simulate both a 
				stack and queue based path finding program. Harry potter
				was in a map of N x N size, and we had to navigate the
				map in the quickest way possible to find the Ring. <br/>
				<strong><u>Data Structures Used: Stacks and Queue. </p></strong></u>
			<h3> <a href="profile/p2/p2.cpp">Project 2: Mine Escape</a></h3>
				<p class="project"> For this project, we were asked to 
				implement priority queues using a Poorman method, a 
				sorted method, a binary heap method, and a pairing heap
				method. This project required a lot of referring to
				documentation. <br/>
				<u><strong>Data Structures Used: Priority Queues</p></strong></u></p>
			<h3> <a href="profile/p3/stockMarket.cpp">Project 3: Stock Market Simulator</a></h3>
				<p class="project"> For this project, we were asked to
				create a program that could simulate a stock market
				based on a list of orders that came in and out. <br/>
				<u><strong>Data Structures Used: Priority Queues, Unordered Maps, Unordered Sets</strong></u></p>
			<h3> <a href="profile/p4/droneRoute.cpp">Project 4: Amazon Drone Delivery</a></h3>
				<p class="project"> For this project, we were asked to 
				create a program that would simulate the path taken by
				an amazon drone based on the available edges and vertices. Created implementations for Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms. In addition, there was also a
				Traveling Salesman problem. <br/>
				<u><strong>Data Structures Used: Priority Queue, Vectors</strong></u></p>
